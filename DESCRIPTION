Title: Visualization and Tools for Ichimoku Kinko Hyo Strategies
Version: 0.1.10
Description: An implementation of 'Ichimoku Kinko Hyo', also commonly known as
    'cloud charts'. Static and interactive visualizations with tools for
    creating, backtesting and development of quantitative 'ichimoku' strategies.
    As described in Sasaki (1996, ISBN:4925152009), the technique is a refinement
    on candlestick charting originating from Japan, now in widespread use in
    technical analysis worldwide. Translating as 'one-glance equilibrium chart',
    it allows the price action and market structure of financial securities to
    be determined 'at-a-glance'.
