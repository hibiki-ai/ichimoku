Title: Ichimoku Kinko Hyo Cloud Charts
Version: 0.1.0
Description: An implementation of the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo charting technique,
    also commonly known as 'cloud charts'. Originating from and popularised in
    Japan, it is a refinement on candlestick charting that is in widespread use
    on trading floors worldwide. Translating to 'one-glance equilibrium
    chart', it allows the price action and market structure of financial
    securities to be determined 'at-a-glance'. This package contains functions
    to compute and plot both static and interactive ichimoku cloud charts.
