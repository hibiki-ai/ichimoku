Title: Compute and Plot Ichimoku Kinko Hyo Cloud Charts
Version: 0.1.2.9003
Description: An implementation of the 'Ichimoku Kinko Hyo' charting system, also
    commonly known as 'cloud charts', providing both publication-ready and
    fully-interactive charts for analysis. As described in Sasaki (1996,
    ISBN:4925152009), the technique is a refinement on candlestick charting
    originating from Japan, now in widespread use in technical analysis worldwide.
    Translating to 'one-glance equilibrium chart', it allows the price action and
    market structure of financial securities to be determined 'at-a-glance'.
