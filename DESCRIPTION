Title: Compute and Plot Ichimoku Kinko Hyo Cloud Charts
Version: 0.1.0.9001
Description: An implementation of the 'Ichimoku Kinko Hyo' charting system,
    also commonly known as 'cloud charts', providing both publication-ready
    and fully-interactive charts for analysis. Originating from and popularised
    in Japan, the technique is a refinement on candlestick charting, in 
    widespread use on trading floors worldwide. Translating to 'one-glance
    equilibrium chart', it allows the price action and market structure of
    financial securities to be determined 'at-a-glance'.
