Visualization and Tools for Ichimoku Kinko Hyo Strategies

An implementation of 'Ichimoku Kinko Hyo', also commonly known as 'cloud charts'. Static and interactive visualizations with tools for creating, backtesting and development of quantitative 'ichimoku' strategies. As described in Sasaki (1996, ISBN:4925152009), the technique is a refinement on candlestick charting originating from Japan, now in widespread use in technical analysis worldwide. Translating as 'one-glance equilibrium chart', it allows the price action and market structure of financial securities to be determined 'at-a-glance'.

## Installation

Install the released version of ichimoku from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("ichimoku")
```

Or install the development version of ichimoku from GitHub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("shikokuchuo/ichimoku")
```

## Example

Load package and sample price data:

```{r load}
library(ichimoku)
TKR <- sample_ohlc_data
```

#### Visualization

Simply `ichimoku()` and `plot()`:

```{r plot}
cloud <- ichimoku(TKR)
plot(cloud, window = "2020-04/")
```

#### Strategies

`autostrat()` to automatically generate top-performing strategies:

```{r auto}
autostrat(cloud, n = 3)
```
