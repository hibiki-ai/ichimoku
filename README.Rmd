An implementation of the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo charting technique, also commonly known as 'cloud charts' in R. Translating to 'one-glance equilibrium chart', it allows the price action and market structure of financial securities to be determined 'at-a-glance'. This R package contains functions to compute and plot both static and interactive ichimoku cloud charts.

## Installation

You can install the released version of ichimoku from [Github](https://github.com) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("shikokuchuo/ichimoku")
```

## Example

Example based on synthetic data:

```{r loaddata, echo = FALSE}
# Sample synthetic data
data <- data.frame(
  Date = do.call(c, lapply(0:4, function (x) seq.POSIXt(
    from = as.POSIXct(paste0("2020-01-", 7 * x + 1)), by = "1 day", l = 5))),
  Open = c(10, seq(11.5, by = 1, l = 9), 20, 20, 18:16, 15:24),
  TKR.high = c(12:21, 20.5, 20:18, 16, 16, 17:25),
  lowprice = c(10:19, 18:14, 14, seq(15, by = 1, l = 9)),
  px_Close = c(12, 12:20, 20, 18:15, seq(15.5, by = 1, l = 10))
)
```

```{r plot}
library(ichimoku)
cloud <- ichimoku(data, ticker = "TKR", periods = c(2, 4, 8))
plot(cloud)
```
