An implementation of the 'Ichimoku Kinko Hyo' charting system, also commonly known as 'cloud charts', providing both publication-ready and fully-interactive charts for analysis. As described in Sasaki (1996, ISBN:4925152009), the technique is a refinement on candlestick charting originating from Japan, now in widespread use in technical analysis worldwide. Translating to 'one-glance equilibrium chart', it allows the market structure and price action of financial securities to be determined 'at-a-glance'.

## Installation

Install the development version of ichimoku from Github with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("shikokuchuo/ichimoku")
```

## Example

Simply `ichimoku()` and `plot()`.

```{r plot}
library(ichimoku)
TKR <- sample_ohlc_data
# Create ichimoku object:
cloud <- ichimoku(TKR)
# Plot ichimoku object:
plot(cloud, from = "2020-05-01", to = "2020-12-03")
```
